# Bare Server V1 Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/v{version}/`

The endpoint `/` on V1 would be `/v1/`

## Request the server to fetch a URL from the remote.

| Method | Endpoint   |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `*`    | /       |

Request Body:

The body will be ignored if the request was made as `GET`. The request body will be forwarded to the remote request made by the bare server.

Request Headers:

```
X-Bare-Host: example.org
X-Bare-Port: 80
X-Bare-Protocol: http:
X-Bare-Path: /index.php
X-Bare-Headers: {"Accept":"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9"}
X-Bare-Forward-Headers: ["accept-encoding","accept-language"]
```

All headers are required. Not specifying a header will result in a 400 status code. All headers are not tampered with, whatever is specified will go directly to the destination.

- X-Bare-Host: The host of the destination WITHOUT the port. This would be equivalent to `URL.hostname` in JavaScript.
- X-Bare-Port: The port of the destination. This must be a valid number. This is not `URL.port`, rather the client needs to determine what port a URL goes to. An example of logic done a the client: the protocol `http:` will go to port 80 if no port is specified in the URL.
- X-Bare-Protocol: The protocol of the destination. V1 bare servers support `http:` and `https:`. If the protocol is not either, this will result in a 400 status code.
- X-Bare-Path: The path of the destination. Be careful when specifying a path without `/` at the start. This may result in an error from the remote.
- X-Bare-Headers: A JSON-serialized object containing request headers. Request header names may be capitalized. When making the request to the remote, capitalization is kept. Consider the header capitalization on `HTTP/1.0` and `HTTP/1.1`. Sites such as Discord check for header capitalization to make sure the client is a web browser.
- X-Bare-Forward-Headers: A JSON-serialized array containing names of case-insensitive request headers to forward to the remote. For example, if the client's useragent automatically specified the `Accept` header and the client can't retrieve this header, it will set X-Bare-Forwarded-Headers to `["accept"]`. The Bare Server will read the `accept` header from the request headers (not X-Bare-Headers`) and add it to the headers sent to the remote. The server will automatically forward the following headers: Content-Encoding, Content-Length, Transfer-Encoding

Response Headers:

```
Content-Encoding: ...
Content-Length: ...
X-Bare-Status: 200
X-Bare-Status-text: OK
X-Bare-Headers: {"Content-Type": "text/html"}
```

- Content-Encoding: The remote body's content encoding.
- Content-Encoding: The remote body's content length.
- X-Bare-Status: The status code of the remote.
- X-Bare-Status-Text: The status text of the remote.
- X-Bare-Headers: A JSON-serialized object containing remote response headers. Response headers may be capitalized if the remote sent any capitalized headers.

Response Body:

The remote's response body will be sent as the response body.

A random character sequence used to identify the WebSocket and it's metadata. 

## Request a new WebSocket ID.

| Method | Endpoint     |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `GET`  | /ws-new-meta |

Response Headers:

```
Content-Type: text/plain
```

Response Body:

The response is a unique sequence of hex encoded bytes.

## Request the server to create a WebSocket tunnel to the remote.

| Method | Endpoint  |
| ------ | --------- |
| `GET`  | /         |

Request Headers:

```
Upgrade: websocket
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: bare, ...
```

- Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: This header contains 2 values: a dummy protocol named `bare` and an encoded, serialized, JSON object.

The JSON object looks like:

```json
{
	"remote": {
		"host": "example.org",
		"port": 80,
		"path": "/ws-path",
		"protocol": "ws:"
	},
	"headers": {
		"Origin": "http://example.org",
		"Sec-WebSocket-Protocol": "original_websocket_protocol"
	},
	"forward_headers": [
		"accept-encoding",
		"accept-language",
		"sec-websocket-extensions",
		"sec-websocket-key",
		"sec-websocket-version"
	],
	"id": "UniqueID_123"
}
```

This serialized JSON is then encoded. See [WebSocketProtocol.md](https://github.com/tomphttp/specifications/blob/master/WebSocketProtocol.md) for in-depth on this encoding.

- remote {Object}: An object similar to `X-Bare-` headers used when making a request.
- headers {Object}: An object similar to `X-Bare-headers`
- forward_headers {Array}: An array similar to `X-Bare-Forward-Headers`. These are all lowercase but may reference capitalized headers.
- id {String}?: The unique id generated by the server. If this field isn't specified, no meta data will be stored, making the response headers inaccessible to the client.

Response Headers:

```
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: bare
```

Sec-WebSocket-Accept: The remote's accept header.

Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: The first value in the list of protocols the client sent.

All headers that aren't listed above are irrelevant. The WebSocket class in browsers can't access response headers.

Response Body:

The response is a stream, forwading bytes from the remote to the client. Once either the remote or client close, the remote and client will close.

## Request the metadata for a specific WebSocket

| Method | Endpoint |
| ------ | -------- |
| `GET`  | /ws-meta |

Request Headers:

```
X-Bare-ID: UniqueID_123
```

- X-Bare-ID: The unique ID returned by the server in the pre-request.

> ⚠ All WebSocket metadata is cleared 30 seconds after the connection was established.

An expired or invalid X-Bare-ID will result in a 400 status code.

Response Headers:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

Response Body:

```json
{
	"headers": {
		"Set-Cookie": [
			"Cookie",
			"Cookie"
		],
		"Sec-WebSocket-Accept": "original_websocket_protocol"
	}
}
```
